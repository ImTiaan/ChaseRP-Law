The trial courts shall be composed of five elected judges. A judge shall serve for six months before being up for re-election.\n\nThe Supreme Court shall be granted the ability to hear all appeals of its choice and hold all appellate authority. The Supreme Court has the choice to garner original jurisdiction for all cases pertaining to Article 3.\n\nAll Justices and Judges shall not hold any other office under the United States or San Andreas, nor shall they act as a magistrate while running for election of any state office, other than re-election of a judicial seat.\n\n### Section 2: Powers and Duties\nThe Courts of San Andreas shall hold sole judicial authority over criminal and civil complaints within San Andreas.

The Supreme Court of San Andreas shall derive the rules of court procedure and evidence, pursuant to laws expanding or limiting the court’s processes.\n\nThe Courts of San Andreas have the power of judicial review, to hold the supreme law of the lands within its jurisdiction above new or old laws. Entire laws, or portions of laws, may be ruled to be in violation of superior law.\n\nThe Courts of San Andreas have the power to define the punishment or mercy granted for crimes committed, at no more or no less than the law allows if specified. When unspecified, the judiciary shall hold the power to define the appropriate penalty.\n\nThe Courts of San Andreas may find persons who testify within their jurisdiction guilty of perjury during trial proceedings. This finding is still subject to the due process granted by appellate review and executive pardon.\n\nThe Supreme Court may hire and appoint Bailiffs, Clerks, and other court personnel to carry out the duties of the Judiciary.\n\nThe Supreme Court shall preside over the San Andreas State Bar. The State Bar shall define and enforce mandatory qualifications and codes of conduct for all legal professionals practicing within the Courts of San Andreas, in conjunction with requirements defined by law. No law or Bar requirement shall infringe upon an individual’s right to represent themselves pro se in court for any proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Article 6  \n### Legislation\n\nLegislative Bills are presented to the trial judges by Bar certified sponsors or the Office of the Governor. Bills shall be initially approved by a majority of Judges to send to the Supreme Court for consideration. Should the Supreme Court approve the bill, the bill must be signed or vetoed by the Governor.\n\n---\n\n## Article 7  \n### Impeachment\n\nAll duly elected judges and state officials are subject to impeachment. An attorney may file for Articles of Impeachment and submit them to the Judges of San Andreas. Impeachment may occur for any section described in Article 3, abuse of authority, corruption, conduct unbecoming, gross derelictions of duty, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The Judges of San Andreas vote by majority to present the Articles to the Supreme Court, which shall then call for a hearing. Should a majority of the Justices find that official guilty of the Articles, that official is removed from office. Impeached officials lose sovereign immunity and may never again be elected to office.\n",
