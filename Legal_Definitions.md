# Legal Standards & Definitions

Understanding these legal concepts is fundamental to proper law enforcement and ensuring your actions are constitutional and admissible in court.

## REASONABLE SUSPICION

Reasonable Suspicion is the legal standard where a law enforcement officer has specific, articulable facts that suggest a person may be involved in criminal activity. A lower standard than probable cause.

**Required For:**
*   Terry Stops
*   Brief Detainment
*   Pat-Down Searches (if officer believes subject is armed and dangerous)
*   Traffic stops

**Example:**
> “Reasonable suspicion allows a stop — not a full search.”

## PROBABLE CAUSE

Probable Cause is the reasonable belief, based on facts and circumstances, that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed. A factual basis that makes it reasonable to believe a crime occurred.

**Required For:**
*   Arrests
*   Search Warrants
*   Warrantless Searches (under exceptions)
*   Seizure of Evidence

**Example:**
> “The officer had probable cause based on what was observed at the scene.”

## DETAIN

A detention is a brief holding for investigation based on Reasonable Suspicion.

Duration MUST NOT be longer than reasonably required. Person is not free to leave.

## ARREST

An arrest requires Probable Cause. Subject is taken into custody for charges.

Miranda warnings required before custodial interrogation. Search incident to arrest is permitted.

## MIRANDA RIGHTS & RIGHT TO COUNSEL

**Miranda Warning**

Constitutional warnings required when a suspect is in custody AND being interrogated.

1.  Right to remain silent
2.  Anything said can be used in court
3.  Right to an attorney
4.  One will be appointed if cannot afford

**Right to Counsel**

A defendant has the right to legal representation. If invoked, questioning must stop until counsel is present.

**Example:**
> “My client clearly requested an attorney.”

## PLAIN VIEW DOCTRINE

Officers can seize evidence without warrant when clearly visible during lawful observation.

Officer must be lawfully present, evidence in plain view, incriminating nature immediately apparent.

## BURDEN OF PROOF

Who must prove the case.

*   Criminal: **The prosecution** must prove guilt.
*   Civil: **The plaintiff** must prove liability.

The defense does not need to prove innocence — only raise doubt.

## DUE PROCESS

The right to fair legal procedures.

Includes:
*   Notice of charges
*   Opportunity to defend
*   Neutral judge

## MOTIONS

A formal request made to the judge.

Common motions:
*   **Motion to Suppress**: Request to exclude evidence obtained unlawfully (e.g., illegal search, no warrant).
*   **Motion to Dismiss**
*   **Motion for Continuance**

**Example:**
> “The defense moves the court to exclude this evidence.”

## CHAIN OF CUSTODY

Proof that evidence was handled properly.

The court wants to know:
*   Who collected it?
*   Where was it stored?
*   Was it altered?

## SUBPOENA

A court order requiring someone to:
*   Appear in court
*   Produce documents

**Example:**
> “The defense subpoenas the surveillance footage and dispatch logs.”

## DEPOSITION

A sworn out-of-court testimony taken before trial.

Used to:
*   Lock in witness statements
*   Gather facts early

## ARRAIGNMENT

The first court appearance where charges are read.

Defendant enters a plea:
*   Guilty
*   Not guilty
*   No contest

## PLEA DEAL

An agreement to resolve a case without trial.

Usually involves reduced charges or reduced sentence.

**Example:**
> “The state is offering a plea in exchange for avoiding trial.”

## CONTEMPT OF COURT

Punishment for disrupting court or refusing orders.

**Example:**
*   Disobeying the judge
*   Ignoring subpoenas

## PREPONDERANCE VS BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT

### **Preponderance of Evidence (Civil Standard)**

Used in civil disputes.

Meaning:
*   More likely than not
*   ~51% certainty

**Example:**
> “It is more probable the claim is true than false.”

### **Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (Criminal Standard)**

Used in criminal trials.

Meaning:
*   Very high certainty
*   No reasonable alternative explanation

**Example:**
> “The evidence leaves no reasonable doubt of guilt.”

## SEARCH & SEIZURE CONCEPTS

### **Warrant**

A court authorization allowing law enforcement to conduct a search or arrest.
*   **General rule:** Searches normally require a warrant.

### **Consent Search**

A search is lawful if a person voluntarily agrees.
*   **Key issue:** Consent must be freely given, not coerced.

**Example:**
> “The defendant never consented to the search.”

### **Exigent Circumstances**

Emergency situations where law enforcement may act without a warrant.

Common examples:
*   Immediate danger to life
*   Risk of evidence destruction
*   Hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect

**Example:**
> “Officers entered without a warrant due to exigent circumstances.”

### **Fruit of the Poisonous Tree**

Evidence obtained from an unlawful search may be excluded.

**Example:**
*   Illegal entry leads to discovery of contraband

## BRADY VIOLATIONS

### **Brady Material**

The prosecution must disclose evidence favorable to the defense.

Includes:
*   Exculpatory evidence (shows innocence)
*   Impeachment evidence (undermines witness credibility)

### **Brady Violation**

Failure to disclose such evidence may result in:
*   Suppression of evidence
*   Case dismissal
*   New trial

**Example:**
> “The state failed to disclose material evidence favorable to the defense.”
