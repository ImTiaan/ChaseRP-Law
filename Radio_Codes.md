## Pursuit Protocols

### Vehicle Pursuit Guidelines

*   Maximum 4 cars allowed in pursuit
*   First car uses sirens and becomes scene command
*   Primary unit's passenger handles communications
*   Secondary unit can handle comms if needed
*   Third unit may parallel at discretion
*   Fourth unit MUST parallel

**ALLEY PROTOCOL:** Secondary and Tertiary units must NEVER follow into alleys. They must parallel. Only Primary pursues in alleys.

Always acknowledge received transmissions with "10-4" and your callsign.

Keep radio transmissions brief and clear. In emergencies, state "10-13A/B" or "10-99" first.
