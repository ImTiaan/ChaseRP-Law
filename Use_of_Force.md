# Use of Force Continuum

The Use of Force Continuum is a critical framework that guides officers in applying appropriate levels of force based on the situation. Always use the minimum force necessary to safely control a situation.

## LEVEL ONE - Officer Presence
**NO FORCE REQUIRED**

Just presence in area. The mere presence of a law enforcement officer in uniform can deter criminal activity and establish control.

## LEVEL TWO - Verbalization
**NO FORCE REQUIRED**

Utilization of verbal commands. Clear, professional communication and lawful orders to gain compliance without physical force.

## LEVEL THREE - Empty Hand Control
**LOW-LEVEL FORCE**

Involves body force including punches, kicks, tackles, and grabbing techniques. Used when verbal commands fail and physical control is necessary.

## LEVEL FOUR - Less Lethal
**INTERMEDIATE FORCE**

Baton, flashlight, tasers, and other less-lethal tools. Designed to incapacitate temporarily without causing permanent injury or death.

## LEVEL FIVE - Lethal Force
**DEADLY FORCE**

Lethal weapons such as firearms. Only authorized when there is an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to yourself or others.

De-escalation should always be attempted when safe and feasible. Use only the force necessary to safely resolve the situation.
